# Russian-travel

This is my third project work. It helped me to master adaptive layout and work with layouts in Figma.

My project tells the benefits of traveling in Russia. Shows beautiful and interesting vacation spots. Shares links to such sights of Russia as Curonian Spit, Kola Peninsula, Altai, winter Baikal, Karelia. Shares a useful link to a trip to Lake Baikal on dogs.

**It uses technologies such as:**

- flexbox layout;
- advanced HTML and CSS capabilities;
- positioning elements;
- adaptive layout;
- grid layout;
